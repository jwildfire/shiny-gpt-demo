# Shiny GPT Demo

I built a little Issue Management Shiny App with ChatGPT.

# Prompt 1: make me an R shiny app that implements a basic issue management system

Made an app that runs but, didn't actually populate the UI :(

# Prompt 2: update the app so that i can edit existing issues

This triggered updates in the UI!

And it added some javascript in datatables to make that table editable.

At this point we've got a functional little prototype. Let's see if we can do more ... 

# Prompt 3: implement a simple database store the issues

This one only gave a partial server function so I went with ...

# Prompt 4: The server function doesn't have a closing curly bracket. fix that please.
